# Bartender App

This app is made of a Node.js backend and a simple React dashboard
bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. Open a new terminal and
run the following to start the backend:

```
cd bartender/service
npm install
npm start
```

Open a different terminal and run the following to start the dashboard:

```
cd bartender/dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

The dashboard should open up on your default browser.
